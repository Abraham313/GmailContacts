# Google Contacts

The app will extract all contacts from Gmail emails. It takes From, To, and Cc fields and saves them into a MongoDB database. Each time the app is executed it will only scan new emails and add them omto a DB (if it's not in DB already).

#### Parsed fields from email
The utility parses below fields from email:

- **To** - To email address
- **From** - From
- **Cc** - CC

If the email already exists in the DB, the app will ignore it and not add or update it. Otherwise it will add it.


#### DB Collections
The utility creates and saves data into bellow MongoDB collections:

##### Contacts Collection
Stores all parsed emails. Has these fields:
- **email** -  the rmail from To, From, Cc fields
- **name** -  name of the contact
- **account** - name of the account. The account represents the unique field that groups all parsed contacts. It's exits mostly so in the future this can be a multi-tenant system.

##### Settings Collection
Settings collection stores the last date when we parsed the email. It has these fields:
- **saved** - last date the utility processed email. This is used so we only check messages after this date and don't constantly check the entire mailbox.
- **account** - the account name for the setting



## Getting Started


### Configure the app

Configure known emails and Mongo constants in main.go:

    // This is the list of emails to ignore when parsing
    var knownEmails = []string{"vlad@collak.net"}

    //these are the DB (Mongo settings)
    const (
        server      = "127.0.0.1"         //DB server address
        dbName      = "GmailContacts"     //DB name
        accountName = "vlad@collak.net"   //the user's account name
    )


### Configure Google app

The app uses Gmail API. To authenticate to this API the app needs to first be added to Google's Developer Console.


### Run
Run the GmailContacts utility using go:

    $ go run main.go


Once it starts, the utility will first check for security credentials. Specifically, it will ask the user to open a specific link in a browser. The page will ask the user to allow the utility to access Gmail. Once approved the user needs to paste the token back into the utility.



    #########################
    #     Authorization     #
    #########################

    Open below link in your browser. Then Allow the client to access your mailbox,get the token and paste it below

    https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?access_type=offline&client_id=4523535455-jdfsfsfdgg7dfadfafdfsdflltghgdk.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn%3Aieaf%3Afg%3Aoauth%3A2.0%3Aoob&response_type=code&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fgmail.readonly&state=state-token

    Paste the token here:4/CdflaksdjhfaldkfhaiC9mWGdfadhlfhaslfasdkdasd

Afterwards the utility will scan user's Gmail, extract the emails and save them into the Mongo DB collection (collection configured as "dbName"). While scanning it will print a log similar to below:
